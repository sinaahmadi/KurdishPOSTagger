# KurdishPOSTagger
As my final project in BS degree at University of Kurdistan, I implemented a POS Tagger for Kurdish language. This tagger which is the first practical one proposed for Kurdish language (for the moment Sorani dialect), uses a hybrid approach of tagging the parts of speech based on a morphological methodology, fully implemented in this research, and then in the next phase, based on a supervised-learning approach using a pre-tagged corpus, a more performant tagger is presented.
